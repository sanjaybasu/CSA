## Impact and cost-effectiveness of community-supported agriculture

- use NHANES Population
- set eligibles to <200% FPL or Medicaid
- calculate their ASCVD scores, and among subset with T2DM their RECODE scores
- baseline is no change in diet, using above scores to simulate 10-year and lifetime risk
- then compare to cash only with 3 point HEI increase and associated changes modeled as a relative risk reduction [do you have a table of delta HEI versus delta ASCVD, delta A1c, and delta all-cause mort?]
- then compare to CSA with 7 point HEI increase modeled as a relative risk reduction
- two perspectives: healthcare system, and societal where latter includes cost of food insecurity?
